This project contains  Python scripts demonstrating basic Python concepts:

1.datatypes.py – Explores different data types and type conversions.
2.control_structures.py – Demonstrates control structures using loops and conditional statements.
3.modular_functions.py – Calculates areas of shapes using a modular function.
4.numpy.py - demonstartes basic numpy 

How to Run the Scripts
1.Clone the Repository:
  git clone <your-github-repo-url>
  cd python_basics
2.Run Each Script:
Data Types:
  python datatypes.py
Control Structures:
  python control_structures.py
Modular Functions:
  python modular_functions.py
Note: Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

lessons learnt :
1.How to work with various Python data types (int, float, list, dict, etc.) and perform type conversions.
2.Using control structures like if-else, for loops, and while loops to control the program flow.
3.Writing modular code with functions to promote reusability and clarity.
4.Basic Git commands for committing and pushing code to GitHub.
5.Handling user input, conditional logic, and loops to solve practical problems.
6.basic numpy code and how to install the numpy library
